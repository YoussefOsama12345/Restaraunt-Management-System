- Generate detailed attendance reports for specific time periods (e.g., weekly, monthly).
- Monitor attendance patterns to identify issues (e.g., frequent absences).
- Export attendance reports in PDF or Excel format for payroll processing.

🛠️ Dependencies:
- SQLAlchemy -> ORM for managing employee and attendance-related database interactions.
- ReportLab -> For generating attendance reports in PDF format.
- openpyxl -> For exporting attendance reports in Excel format (optional).
- logging -> For logging attendance transactions and errors.
