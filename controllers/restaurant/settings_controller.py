settings_controller.py

This module handles the management of application settings in the Restaurant Management System (RMS).
It allows administrators to configure system-wide settings such as operational hours, tax rates, discount policies, 
and notification preferences.

📌 Features:
- Configure restaurant operating hours (e.g., opening and closing times).
- Set system-wide tax rates and discount policies.
- Manage notification settings for alerts (e.g., reservation reminders, order status updates).
- Save and retrieve configuration data to/from persistent storage (database or file).
- Provide functionality for resetting settings to default values.

🛠️ Dependencies:
- SQLAlchemy -> ORM for managing settings-related database interactions.
- json or ConfigParser -> For handling configuration files (optional).
- logging -> For logging setting changes and errors.
- datetime -> For timestamping setting modifications.
