This module handles the user management functionality for the Restaurant Management System (RMS). 
It includes actions like user registration, login, updating user details, and managing roles.

Libraries:
----------
- `validation`: Contains functions to validate user inputs such as email, password, and user details.
- `user_service`: Provides business logic related to user management, including creation, update, and authentication.
- `hashing`: Used for password hashing to secure sensitive information.

Key Functions:
--------------
1. `register_user`: 
    - Handles the user registration process, including validation of the user details and password hashing.
    - Calls the user service to add the new user to the database.

2. `login_user`: 
    - Authenticates the user by verifying the provided email and password.
    - Uses hashed password verification for security.

3. `update_user_details`: 
    - Allows the user to update their details like email, password, and role.
    - Validates the updated information and stores it securely.

4. `build_user_management_screen`: 
    - Constructs the UI for managing user data, including displaying user information and action buttons for updating or deleting users.

Examples:
---------
- A user registers with their email and password, which are validated before being added to the system.
- An admin can update user roles or information.
