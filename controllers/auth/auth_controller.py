auth_controller.py - Manages Authentication and Session Logic for the Restaurant Management System (RMS).

This module defines the `AuthController` class, which is responsible for handling user authentication processes, 
including login, password recovery, session management, and password resets. It connects the front-end (UI) to the backend logic 
for authentication, providing functionalities such as validating user credentials, creating and managing sessions, and recovering forgotten passwords.

Libraries:
----------
- `os`: Used for system interactions and generating random session tokens.
- `time`: For managing time-related operations (e.g., session timeouts).

Key Features:
-------------
- Handles user login and credential validation.
- Manages password recovery by verifying the PIN and secret answer.
- Allows users to reset their passwords.
- Creates and manages user sessions with unique session tokens.
- Logs users out and invalidates their sessions.
- Ensures secure handling of sensitive information like passwords and sessions.

Class:
------
- `AuthController`: Handles all authentication and session management processes for the Restaurant Management System.

Methods:
--------
1. login_user(username: str, password: str) -> bool:
    - Validates user credentials by checking them against the local database.
    - Args:
        - username (str): The email or username of the user.
        - password (str): The user's password.
    - Returns: 
        - bool: True if the credentials are correct, False otherwise.

2. recover_password(username: str, pin: str, secret_answer: str) -> bool:
    - Verifies the user's identity by matching their PIN and secret answer.
    - Args:
        - username (str): The email or username of the user.
        - pin (str): The user's PIN.
        - secret_answer (str): The answer to the security question.
    - Returns:
        - bool: True if the PIN and secret answer match the stored values, False otherwise.

3. reset_password(username: str, new_password: str) -> bool:
    - Allows the user to reset their password after successfully verifying their identity.
    - Args:
        - username (str): The email or username of the user.
        - new_password (str): The new password to set for the user.
    - Returns:
        - bool: True if the password was successfully reset, False otherwise.

4. create_session(username: str) -> str:
    - Creates a user session by generating a unique session token for the user.
    - Args:
        - username (str): The email or username of the user.
    - Returns:
        - str: A session token if successful, None if an error occurs.

5. logout_user(session_token: str) -> bool:
    - Logs the user out by invalidating their session token.
    - Args:
        - session_token (str): The session token to invalidate.
    - Returns:
        - bool: True if the user was successfully logged out, False otherwise.

6. _generate_session_token() -> str:
    - Generates a random, unique session token for the user session.
    - Returns:
        - str: A random string used as the session token.
